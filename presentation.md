# Why We Need an MFP Simulator

* Printers are large, heavy, and expensive.
* Maintaining a representative collection is difficult, even for corporations.
* Printing and scanning software is complex.
* Development, troubleshooting, and support require reproducibility.
* Accurate simulation would be a solution.

# Scope of This Project

* Standard printing protocol (IPP).
* Standard scanning protocols (eSCL and WSD).
* IPP over USB simulation.
* DNS-SD and WS-Discovery advertising.
* Probably, semi-accurate implementation of legacy printing protocols,
  for completeness.
* Proprietary protocols not implemented and not planned.

# What is Behaviorally Accurate?

* For the standard protocols, behavior is defined by the specification
  and printer attributes/scanner capabilities.
* But this is not enough. Real hardware often deviate from these
  specifications.
* Model must define not only device parameters but the details of the
  actual device behavior.

# How accurate can be our models?

* The actual limiting factor is our detailed knowledge of the particular
  model.
* But 100% accuracy is not required. It is enough to reproduce essential
  details.
* In many cases it is enough just to reproduce the problem.

---
# Creation of models
![bg left:40%](images/phonograph.jpg)

* A model is a "recording" of a device's core capabilities â€” a simple
  collection of its printer attributes and scanner capabilities,
  made without behavioral details.
* The mfp-model tool records these baseline models automatically from
  real hardware.
* The mfp-virtual tool playbacks a model to emulate the original hardware.

This is the fragment of the `Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn` eSCL scanner,
automatically generated with the `mfp-model` tool.
